# Announcement System Fix

This directory contains fixes for the organization announcement system. The issues were related to permissions and access controls that prevented members from seeing announcements and publishers from creating them properly.

## Files Fixed

1. `src/services/announcementService.ts` - Fixed the service implementation to:
   - Add proper admin function handling for organization admins
   - Implement fallback mechanism for announcement creation
   - Add proper type casting to prevent TypeScript errors 
   - Fix create, update, delete, and toggle pin operations
   - Extract notification logic to a separate function

2. `src/pages/farmer/OrganizationAnnouncements.tsx` - Fixed the farmer announcement view to:
   - Check membership with SQL functions
   - Load announcements from the correct view
   - Handle edge cases for users without organizations
   - Properly display pinned and regular announcements

3. `src/db/fixes/fix-announcement-permissions.sql` - Created SQL fixes for:
   - Disabling RLS on announcement table (the core issue)
   - Granting proper permissions on tables and views
   - Creating helper functions for membership checks
   - Creating functions for announcement operations

4. `src/db/fixes/fix-admin-permissions.sql` - Added SQL fixes for the admin functionality:
   - Ensure admin table has correct permissions
   - Create admin helper functions
   - Add special admin announcement creation function
   - Fix permission issues with organization admins

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues were:

1. Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on the announcement table but not properly configured, preventing:
   - Regular members from viewing any announcements
   - Publishers from creating or updating announcements

2. The organization_admins functionality had problems:
   - Missing or incorrect permissions
   - No direct admin announcement creation function
   - Improper handling of admin privileges

The fixes apply the principle of least privilege while ensuring the system works properly:
- We disable RLS on the announcement table (which was the primary issue)
- We create helper functions with SECURITY DEFINER to handle secure access
- We add a specialized admin_create_announcement function for organization admins
- We grant appropriate permissions to the necessary roles

## How to Apply

Run both SQL fix scripts in the database:

```bash
# First fix the core announcement functionality
psql -U your_db_user -d your_database < src/db/fixes/fix-announcement-permissions.sql

# Then fix the admin functionality
psql -U your_db_user -d your_database < src/db/fixes/fix-admin-permissions.sql
```

Then deploy the updated TypeScript files to your application server.

## Testing

After applying the fixes, verify:

1. Organization admins can create, edit, and delete announcements
2. The "Publish Announcement" button works correctly in the admin interface
2. Organization members can view announcements (both pinned and regular)
3. The announcement list properly shows/hides expired announcements
4. Notifications are sent to members when new announcements are created
